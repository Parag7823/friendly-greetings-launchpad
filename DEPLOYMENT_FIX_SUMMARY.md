# Critical Deployment Fix - Oct 31, 2025

## Problem
Container was running OLD CODE despite multiple deployments. Methods `_normalize_entity_type`, `_store_entity_matches`, and `_store_platform_patterns` exist in source code but were missing in deployed container.

## Root Cause
**Docker layer caching** - The `CACHEBUST` ARG in Dockerfile was declared but NEVER USED, so Docker reused cached layers from before the methods were added.

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed Dockerfile** (line 27-28):
   - Changed `ARG CACHEBUST=20251031-v2`
   - Added `RUN echo "Cache bust: $CACHEBUST"` to actually USE the arg
   - This forces Docker to invalidate ALL subsequent layers

2. **Code Fixes Included**:
   - ✅ CRITICAL FIX #20: Added `file_id` to `raw_events` insertion (line 8901)
   - ✅ CRITICAL FIX #21: Populate `metadata` and `key_factors` in relationships
   - ✅ CRITICAL FIX #22: AI semantic enrichment with Groq/Llama for relationships
   - ✅ CRITICAL FIX #23: Validate `file_id` before row processing (line 8776)

## Methods Verified Present in Code
All three methods exist in `ExcelProcessor` class (lines 7639-10506):
- `_normalize_entity_type` - line 10481
- `_store_entity_matches` - line 10189
- `_store_platform_patterns` - line 10234

## Expected Results After Deployment
1. ✅ `raw_events` table will have `file_id` populated
2. ✅ `relationship_instances` will have semantic fields populated
3. ✅ `normalized_entities` will populate (no more `_normalize_entity_type` error)
4. ✅ `entity_matches` will populate (no more `_store_entity_matches` error)
5. ✅ `platform_patterns` will populate (no more `_store_platform_patterns` error)

## Deployment Instructions
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "CRITICAL: Force Docker cache invalidation + all fixes"
git push origin main
```

## Verification
After deployment, check logs for:
- ✅ "Created raw_record with file_id=..." 
- ✅ "Stored X relationships with database IDs"
- ❌ NO MORE "object has no attribute '_normalize_entity_type'" errors
- ❌ NO MORE "object has no attribute '_store_entity_matches'" errors
- ❌ NO MORE "object has no attribute '_store_platform_patterns'" errors

## Why This Will Work
The `RUN echo "Cache bust: $CACHEBUST"` command references the ARG, forcing Docker to:
1. Detect the ARG value changed (v1 → v2)
2. Invalidate cache for this layer and ALL subsequent layers
3. Re-copy ALL Python files with the new code
4. Rebuild the container with the latest methods

This is the DEFINITIVE fix for the deployment issue.
