# Entity Resolution Over-Merging Fix - Application Guide

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED

The entity resolution system was over-merging entities with different names just because they shared the same email or bank account. This has been fixed with a comprehensive solution.

## 📁 Files Created

1. **`supabase/migrations/20250810000000-fix-entity-resolution-over-merging.sql`** - Database migration
2. **`fix_overmerged_entities.sql`** - Cleanup script for existing data
3. **`apply_entity_fix.py`** - Automated application script (may not work with Supabase RPC)
4. **`ENTITY_FIX_APPLICATION_GUIDE.md`** - This guide

## 🔧 Manual Application Steps

### Step 1: Apply the Migration

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250810000000-fix-entity-resolution-over-merging.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the migration

### Step 2: Clean Up Existing Over-Merged Entities

1. In the same SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `fix_overmerged_entities.sql`
3. Click **Run** to execute the cleanup

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

Run this query to check the results:

```sql
SELECT 
    entity_type,
    canonical_name,
    array_length(aliases, 1) as alias_count,
    email,
    bank_account
FROM normalized_entities 
WHERE user_id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
ORDER BY alias_count DESC, canonical_name;
```

## 🎯 What the Fix Does

### Before (BROKEN):
- All employees with same email → ONE entity with 100+ aliases
- All vendors with same bank account → ONE entity with 100+ aliases
- No name similarity checks

### After (FIXED):
- Entities only merge if names are similar (≥0.8 similarity)
- Different names create separate entities even with shared identifiers
- Proper name similarity calculations

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### 1. Re-run Entity Resolution Tests
```bash
# Test entity resolution
GET /test-entity-resolution

# Test entity search
GET /test-entity-search/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000?search_term=Abhishek&entity_type=employee
GET /test-entity-search/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000?search_term=Razorpay&entity_type=vendor
```

### 2. Expected Results
- **Before**: 1 employee entity with 100+ aliases
- **After**: Multiple employee entities with similar names grouped together
- **Before**: 1 vendor entity with 100+ aliases  
- **After**: Multiple vendor entities with similar names grouped together

### 3. Verify Entity Separation
- "Abhishek A." and "John Smith" should be separate entities
- "Razorpay Payout" and "Stripe Inc" should be separate entities
- Only truly similar names should be merged

## 🔍 Key Changes Made

### Database Function (`find_or_create_entity`)
- **Added name similarity checks** before merging by email/bank_account
- **Requires ≥0.8 similarity** to merge entities with shared identifiers
- **Creates new entities** when names are too different
- **Improved logging** for debugging

### Backend Code
- **Simplified entity resolution** to use the improved database function
- **Removed redundant logic** that was bypassed by the database function
- **Cleaner code structure** with better error handling

## 🚀 Performance Impact

- **Minimal performance impact** - similarity checks are fast
- **Better data quality** - prevents data corruption from over-merging
- **Improved accuracy** - entities are properly separated

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If the migration fails:
1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Ensure you have service role permissions
3. Try running the SQL in smaller chunks

### If entities are still over-merged:
1. Check the similarity threshold (0.8) - adjust if needed
2. Verify the migration was applied correctly
3. Run the cleanup script again

### If new entities aren't being created:
1. Check the `v_should_merge` logic in the function
2. Verify the similarity calculation is working
3. Check entity_matches table for debugging info

## 📊 Monitoring

After applying the fix, monitor:
- Entity creation rates
- Similarity scores in entity_matches table
- User feedback on entity resolution accuracy

## ✅ Success Criteria

The fix is successful when:
- [ ] Entity resolution tests show separate entities for different names
- [ ] No entities have >10 aliases unless they're truly similar
- [ ] New data processing creates appropriate entity separations
- [ ] Entity search returns relevant, properly separated results

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Apply the migration** using the manual steps above
2. **Test with your existing data** to verify the fix
3. **Re-run your AI tests** to confirm improved results
4. **Monitor the system** for any issues
5. **Deploy to production** when satisfied with the results

**Note**: This fix addresses the root cause of entity over-merging and should provide a robust, long-term solution for entity resolution accuracy.
