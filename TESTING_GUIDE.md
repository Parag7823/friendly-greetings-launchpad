# 🚀 Finley AI Testing Guide

## 📋 **SIMPLE TESTING OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Automatic Batch Testing (EASIEST)**

**What it does:**
- Uploads all 10 test files automatically
- Runs all advanced tests automatically
- Gives you a complete report

**How to use:**
1. Make sure your backend is running: `python fastapi_backend.py`
2. Run the batch script: `python batch_upload_script.py`
3. Wait for results (about 2-3 minutes)

**What you'll see:**
```
🚀 FINLEY AI BATCH TEST SUITE
==================================================

📁 STEP 1: Uploading All 10 Test Files
----------------------------------------
[1/10] Processing: company_bank_statements.csv
📤 Uploading: company_bank_statements.csv
✅ Uploaded successfully! Job ID: abc123

[2/10] Processing: company_invoices.csv
📤 Uploading: company_invoices.csv
✅ Uploaded successfully! Job ID: def456

... (continues for all 10 files)

🧪 STEP 3: Running Advanced Feature Tests
----------------------------------------
🔍 Testing: Currency Normalization
✅ Currency Normalization: PASSED

🔍 Testing: Vendor Standardization
✅ Vendor Standardization: PASSED

... (continues for all tests)

📊 TEST SUMMARY
==================================================
Files Uploaded: 10/10
Advanced Tests Run: 10
✅ Passed: 10
❌ Failed: 0
⚠️  Errors: 0

🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED! System is working perfectly!
```

### **Option 2: Postman Collection (MANUAL)**

**What it does:**
- You manually run each test
- More control over individual tests
- Good for debugging specific issues

**How to use:**
1. Open Postman
2. Import `Finley_AI_Complete_Test_Collection.json`
3. Set your variables (API keys, URLs)
4. Run the collection

### **Option 3: Web Interface (VISUAL)**

**What it does:**
- Use the web app to upload files
- See real-time progress
- Visual interface

**How to use:**
1. Start backend: `python fastapi_backend.py`
2. Open your React app in browser
3. Upload files through the web interface

## 🎯 **WHAT GETS TESTED**

### **File Upload & Processing:**
- ✅ Upload all 10 test files
- ✅ Process each file row by row
- ✅ Store data in database
- ✅ Real-time progress updates

### **Data Enrichment:**
- ✅ Currency conversion (INR → USD)
- ✅ Vendor name cleaning ("GOOGLE LLC" → "Google")
- ✅ Platform ID extraction (Stripe IDs, Razorpay IDs)
- ✅ Metadata addition (timestamps, descriptions)

### **AI Features:**
- ✅ Platform detection (Stripe, Razorpay, AWS, etc.)
- ✅ Relationship detection (invoices ↔ payments)
- ✅ Entity resolution (matching similar names)
- ✅ Dynamic learning (new platforms, patterns)

### **Advanced Features:**
- ✅ Cross-file linking
- ✅ Relationship pattern learning
- ✅ Multi-currency support
- ✅ Error handling and fallbacks

## 📊 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

### **If Everything Works:**
```
✅ All 10 files uploaded successfully
✅ 1500+ rows processed
✅ 25+ relationships detected
✅ 5+ platforms identified
✅ Currency conversions completed
✅ Vendor standardization working
✅ AI features functioning
```

### **If Something Fails:**
```
❌ File upload failed → Check backend is running
❌ Database error → Check SQL migrations were run
❌ AI features not working → Check OpenAI API key
❌ Relationships not found → Check file interconnections
```

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Backend not running"**
   - Run: `python fastapi_backend.py`
   - Check: `http://localhost:8000/health`

2. **"Database tables missing"**
   - Run SQL migrations in Supabase
   - Check tables exist in database

3. **"File upload fails"**
   - Check file paths are correct
   - Verify files exist in `test_files/` folder

4. **"AI features not working"**
   - Check OpenAI API key is set
   - Verify internet connection

## 📈 **UNDERSTANDING THE RESULTS**

### **What Success Looks Like:**
- **10/10 files uploaded** = All test files processed
- **10/10 tests passed** = All features working
- **1500+ rows processed** = Large dataset handled
- **25+ relationships** = Cross-file linking working
- **5+ platforms detected** = AI platform detection working

### **What to Check in Database:**
```sql
-- Check if data was stored
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM raw_events;

-- Check if relationships were found
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM relationships;

-- Check if platforms were detected
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM platform_patterns;
```

## 🎉 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**Your system is working perfectly if:**
- ✅ All 10 files upload successfully
- ✅ All 10 advanced tests pass
- ✅ Database contains processed data
- ✅ Relationships are detected between files
- ✅ Currency conversions work
- ✅ Vendor standardization works
- ✅ Platform detection works
- ✅ AI features are functioning

**If you see this, you're ready for production! 🚀**
