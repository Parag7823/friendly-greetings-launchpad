**Obvio AI - The First Full-Time AI Finance Employees**

For early stage founders setting up a finance team is hard. Hiring a full-time CFO costs too much and junior accountants struggle alone. What they really need is intelligence at a fraction of the cost. And even well funded companies still run on unstructured exports, fragile spreadsheets and different scattered tools . It is not just slow but there is simply no system today that can handle financeand compliance on its own without people constantly stepping in.

Obvio AI is building autonomous finance employees that run your back office for you. Finley is just the first. Over the next 10 years we will roll out a full stack of intelligent agents:

Finley turns messy data into clean ledgers,
Tess optimizes and executes cash operations,
Lexi Handles filings, audits, and compliance 24/7,
Nova Giving VCs, investor and founders portfolio intelligence,
Aria finding and matching companies with the right growth capital
Each agent builds on the last as Agent action needs clean data and deep context. So by sequencing trust first then automation we are actually building a system that compounds in value for every company that joins.

Before we bring autonomy in payments, filings or any other part of compliance we need a ledger users can trust. Finley builds that base file by file, match by match, line by line. In early rollouts it already closing books 3 days faster, hitting 97% accuracy and pulling a 90+ NPS all before we add deep intelligence. Finely is being build in 7 layers—each designed to mimic what a full-time finance analyst does across weeks of work:

1. Ingesting unorganized data 2. Normalizing it into clean . 3. Computing Metrics 4. Simulating on financial suitations. 5. Agent layer 6. Memory graph 7. Explainability layer

Shipping layer by layer to prove value early and to build trust. Each layer unlocks the next.
This repo is where Finley comes to life. Backend runs on FastAPI. Frontend’s being built on Lovable AI. Cursor for writing code.

By 2035 Obvio will run finance and compliance department for millions of companies saving billions of hours and becoming the operating layer for modern business. It will handle complex financial operations like compliance, filings and analysis even for companies with multiple branches across different geographies by adapting to local rule and workflows acting like a full-stack finance team that just works and no matter where you operate.
