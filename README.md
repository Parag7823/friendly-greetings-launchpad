Layer 1 – Data Ingestion (Revolutionary version)

Current: Upload messy exports from multiple sources.
Future: Autonomous, zero-effort ingestion from anywhere.

Core Idea

No manual file uploads ever again.

Finley “hunts” for your financial data automatically — directly from email, cloud storage, accounting platforms, bank APIs, even scanned PDFs in a Dropbox folder.

Works across borders, currencies, and platforms, without asking you for credentials every time.

Key Innovations

Self-learning connectors — If Finley sees a new file format once, it instantly learns it for all users globally.

Pattern-based data hunting — Finley scans email inboxes, Slack messages, WhatsApp attachments (with permission) for relevant financial documents in real-time.

Full historical catch-up — Onboarding once pulls all past years of records in hours, not weeks.

📌 Result: Zero “where’s the file” moments. Founders never think about uploading again.

Layer 2 – Data Normalization (Revolutionary version)

Current: Parse and clean data into a structured format.
Future: Global Finance Rosetta Stone.

Core Idea

Every messy file is normalized into the single universal finance schema — like Google Translate but for money.

Works instantly across 1,000+ formats, currencies, accounting standards (GAAP, IFRS, local rules).

Key Innovations

Universal financial grammar — Finley can understand a ledger whether it’s a PDF in Thai Baht, an Excel in German, or a JSON from an obscure ERP in Brazil.

Context-aware enrichment — Missing fields (e.g., vendor country, tax code) are inferred from global knowledge.

Anomaly-first cleaning — Instead of just “fixing” data, Finley flags the exact weird line items humans should see.

Global compliance mapping — While normalizing, Finley already maps transactions to local compliance codes (e.g., GST in India, VAT in EU) — no extra step later.

📌 Result: Every transaction in the world speaks the same “financial language” instantly.

Summary
Layer 1–3 Functional Scope

Layer 1 – Ingestion: File uploads, connectors, and live sync AND SOME OTHER MORE.

Layer 2 – Normalization: Relationship detection, entity resolver, duplication handler, extractors, transaction batching, and streaming processors and SOME OTHER MORE.

Layer 3 – Finance Logic: Core financial intelligence — metrics, projections, variance models, decision engine, and “Explain this” AI.
